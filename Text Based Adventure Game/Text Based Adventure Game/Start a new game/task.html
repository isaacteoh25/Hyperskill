<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you will implement the new game function and the game stats.</p>

<p>You need a game function that allows you to store all the necessary items and use them in your playthrough. The game stats will be saved once the player advances to another level.</p>

<p>You need to store important variables when creating a new game such as the character attributes, inventory, difficulty, the remaining lives, level, and the username.</p>

<p>To create a new game, ask for the game variables, and if a player makes a mistake by choosing to create a new game, give them an option to go back to the main menu before creating a new player.</p>

<p>The character attributes include the <code class="java">Name</code>, <code class="java">Species</code>, and the <code class="java">Gender</code>.</p>

<p>The inventory includes things like <code class="java">Snack</code>, <code class="java">Weapon</code>, <code class="java">Tool</code>.</p>

<p>Difficulty levels are <code class="java">Easy</code>, <code class="java">Medium</code> and <code class="java">Hard</code>.</p>

<p>The number of lives is <code class="java">5</code>, <code class="java">3</code> or <code class="java">1</code>.</p>

<p>You should get these game variables in the same order as in the examples.</p>

<p>The Level starts with 1 (the first level). The game is going to have 2 levels in total at the end.</p>

<p>For the save file path, use %<em>saves/&lt;username&gt;.txt%</em>. In this case, each user will have their own save file. Don't worry, you won't implement saving progress in this stage, this path will be used in later stages.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create and store the game state with variable inputs such as the inventory, character attributes, difficulty, remaining lives, and the username for the save file path.</li>
	<li>Have the option to go back to the menu before creating a new game. Don't forget that it should handle all the letter cases.</li>
	<li>Before the new game starts, output the message with the game stats such as the character traits, inventory, and difficulty.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
