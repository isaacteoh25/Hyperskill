title: Text Based Adventure Game
language: English
summary: Everyone who plays videogames these days knows that they have very good visuals.
  It was not the case though during the early days of the industry. Many of the first
  videogames were text-based. "Colossal Cave Adventure" was arguably one of the most
  influential of them. There were no visuals, only big chunks of text, extended gameplay,
  a story, and the ability to save and load your progress. Use this project to create
  a similar text-based adventure game with a story written by you.<br/><br/>Learn
