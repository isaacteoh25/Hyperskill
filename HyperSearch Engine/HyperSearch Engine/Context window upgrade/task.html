<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Work with context windows to make them pretty and convenient. You should highlight the words from the query, merge several windows into one if they are overlapping, and extend the borders of the windows so that they can match a whole sentence.</p>

<p>First, you need to check the windows for overlapping. It happens when two windows (A and B) are in the same line, but the ending index of A is less than (or equal to) the starting index of B, or the ending index of A is bigger (or equal to) than the starting index of B. The windows also overlap when their borders coincide.</p>

<p>If the windows do overlap, combine them into one. You need to find their joint starting and ending index and then assign this new index as new. The resulting list should include both positions (see the examples below).</p>

<p>Further, you need to extend the window's borders to match a sentence. For example, you have a window size of 2, and the following line: <code class="language-html">Spring had come early that year</code>. The token position is <code class="language-html">[0,0,6]</code> , the window borders are 0 and 15. Now you need to find the end of this sentence and assign new window borders — 0 and 31.</p>

<p>One more example of overlapping windows. You have a small sentence: <code class="language-html">Mary and Lisa went shopping in town</code>. There are two context windows for the query we are looking for: <code class="language-html">Mary and Lisa</code> and <code class="language-html">Lisa went shopping</code>. The <code class="language-html">Lisa</code> token is overlapping, so they should be combined into <code class="language-html">Mary and Lisa went shopping</code>. However, this is not the whole sentence, so extended to the very end of the sentence.</p>

<p>The sentence boundaries may be obscure as there are all sorts of abbreviations, initials, and other stuff. Punctuation marks can help you with that, you can use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ready-made patterns</a> with <code class="language-html">re</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">PATTERN = re.compile(r’[\.!?]+')</code></pre>

<p>The last feature should highlight the words from the query. It uses tags <code class="language-html">&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code class="language-html">&lt;/b&gt;</code> and inserts them at the begging and to the end of a token to make it bold. For example, you have the following context window: <code class="language-html">Spring had come early that year.</code> for a <code class="language-html">Spring</code> query, the pattern would highlight the word: <code class="language-html">&lt;b&gt;Spring&lt;/b&gt;<strong> </strong>had come early that year.</code> If there is more than one word in a query, then each of them would be highlighted. These tags work with the HTML markup. It can be important if you want to write a search interface after completing a project.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>During testing, you will get two context windows as input (strings). Your output should either consist of two independent windows with extended boundaries and query words highlighted or of one combined window in case the given windows overlap, also with extended boundaries and words highlighted. So your program should do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If there are two windows, check whether they overlap.</li>
	<li>If they overlap, combine them into one.</li>
	<li>If you have one window, take it as input and expand its boundaries.</li>
	<li>Attach tags <code class="language-html">&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code class="language-html">&lt;/b&gt;</code> to the start and the end of the main tokens.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's break it down. The first window is a <code class="language-html">Spring had come early that year.</code> line, the token position is <code class="language-html">[0,0,6]</code>, window borders are 0 and 15. The second window is a <code class="language-html">Spring had come early that year.</code> line, the token position is <code class="language-html">[0,11,15]</code>, window borders 7 and 21. <code class="language-html">Spring had come</code> is overlapping the second window <code class="language-html">had come early</code>. Combine them to get a new <code class="language-html">Spring had come early</code> window, the window borders are 0 and 21, the positions are <code class="language-html">[[0,0,6], [0,11,15]]</code>. Extend the window to <code class="language-html">&lt;b&gt;Spring&lt;/b&gt; had &lt;b&gt;come&lt;/b&gt; early that year.</code>, the borders are 0 and 31, the positions are represented as a <code class="language-html">[[0,0,6], [0,11,15]]</code> list .</p>

<p>Note that the output should contain one window, printed like in the previous stage if the given windows are overlapping, and two windows, printed one after another if the windows do not overlap.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="language-html">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: <em>Windows are overlapping</em></p>

<p>Input: two windows, the window size is two.</p>

<p>Output: one window (since the first window goes to the second sentence and merges with the second window); the line consists of two sentences</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&gt; I feel sure she loves lilies. And they are so appropriate to a bride.|[[0, 22, 28]]|12|38
&gt; I feel sure she loves lilies. And they are so appropriate to a bride.|[[0, 34, 38]]|22|45
I feel sure she loves &lt;b&gt;lilies&lt;/b&gt;. And &lt;b&gt;they&lt;/b&gt; are so appropriate to a bride.|[[0, 22, 28], [0, 34, 38]]|0|69</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: <em>Windows are overlapping within one sentence</em></p>

<p>Input: two windows, the window size is 1</p>

<p>Output: one window</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&gt; You know you promised to obey.|[[0, 9, 12]]|4|21
&gt; You know you promised to obey.|[[0, 13, 21]]|9|24
You know &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;promised&lt;/b&gt; to obey.|[[0, 9, 12], [0, 13, 21]]|0|30</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong>: <em>Windows are not overlapping</em> </p>

<p>Input: two windows, the window size is one</p>

<p>Output: two windows</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&gt; Oh, by the by, dear, I shan’t be able to go with you today. I’ve rather a headache.|[[0, 53, 58]]|49|58
&gt; Oh, by the by, dear, I shan’t be able to go with you today. I’ve rather a headache.|[[0, 74, 82]]|72|82
Oh, by the by, dear, I shan’t be able to go with you &lt;b&gt;today&lt;/b&gt;.|[[0, 53, 58]]|0|59
I’ve rather a &lt;b&gt;headache&lt;/b&gt;.|[[0, 74, 82]]|60|83</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong>: <em>Windows are not overlapping within one sentence</em></p>

<p>Input: two windows, the window size is one</p>

<p>Output: there will be two windows with the same line</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&gt; Yes, she must be clever to have obtained the position that she has.|[[0, 5, 8]]|0|13
&gt; Yes, she must be clever to have obtained the position that she has.|[[0, 45, 53]]|41|58
Yes, &lt;b&gt;she&lt;/b&gt; must be clever to have obtained the position that she has.|[[0, 5, 8]]|0|67
Yes, she must be clever to have obtained the &lt;b&gt;position&lt;/b&gt; that she has.|[[0, 45, 53]]|0|67</code></pre>
