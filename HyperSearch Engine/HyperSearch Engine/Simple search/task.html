<h2><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal;"></strong>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you will create a simple search program. Let's start! A search engine looks for token coordinates in the database that you have created. Once the texts are tokenized and indexed, you will be able to get a list of all token positions. A good engine should process and find several tokens in one string. A good engine also should be able to process a set of documents. Even though you are not making a browser version of the search engine in this project, it may be a good idea to think about how to display the results, as there may be too many search results. Imagine you went through 10 documents and found a certain number of positions in each of them. Maybe you do not want to look through all the documents, as the first three are enough. You need to think about some kind of a limiter to output (also known as <strong>limit</strong>) only the necessary documents. A limit is a number that controls how many search results to display. If there are 10 documents, and you need to display only 3 of them, then the limit will be 3, and only three documents will be displayed as a search result. We also have a parameter called <strong>offset.</strong> An offset is also a number, but it stands for the sequential number of the document that you want to show. For example, you still want to see three documents, and you want to start not from the first, but from the fifth document. Then the result will show three documents that come under the numbers five, six, and seven in the original search array.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>To successfully complete this stage your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take a directory from the input.</li>
	<li>Tokenize and index each file from the directory and create a database (as in the previous step).</li>
	<li>Take a query (a line of words), the limit, and the offset.</li>
	<li>Tokenize it and remember the words.</li>
	<li>Find each token in the database with its filename and positions.</li>
	<li>Get the names of the files containing all tokens; if you have several text files in the database and want to find two words there, then you only need those files where both of these words are encountered. The distance between these tokens in one file is not relevant.</li>
	<li>Sort by filenames and shorten the results by limit and offset; note that the offset should be more than 0; if it is a negative number, set the offset to 0 automatically. If the limit is bigger than the total amount of files, the limit should be set at this exact amount (beware, the limit can be 0; in this case, no results should be displayed).</li>
	<li>Return the data from the database; one or several filenames and all corresponding token positions for query tokens —<code class="java">{'filename.txt': [[first_position], [second_position]]}</code>;</li>
	<li> Print the results in the following format: <code class="java">&lt;filename_1&gt;: a list of positions; &lt;filename_2&gt;: a list of positions</code> so that they can be checked.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sort the word positions in ascending order. It means that if you are looking for two words in a file, the first position in the list should be that of a token that occurred the first.</p>

<p>If a word is not found in the database, output an empty dictionary. If several words are given in a query, and at least one of them is missing, output an empty dictionary as well.</p>

<p>Do not forget to test your code. You need to create text files, index them, and build a small test base using the indexer. This time, check whether your program works when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There is one file,</li>
	<li>There are a lot of files,</li>
	<li>Some or all words in the query cannot be found in the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clear the database after indexing.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p>During tests, you are given a test directory. Input is a folder path, where you need to find and process all text files. Your program should take this path and iterate over files. Clear your database after each test.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>You are looking for one word and need only one file</em></p>

<p>Folder contents: <em>testfile1.txt</em>, <em>testfile2.txt</em>, <em>testfile3.txt</em></p>

<p><em>testfile1.txt </em>contents:<br>
<code class="java">Scarlett made a mouth of bored impatience.</code></p>

<p><em>testfile2.txt </em>contents:<br>
<code class="java">Look, Scarlett. About tomorrow</code></p>

<p><em>testfile3.txt </em>contents:<br>
<code class="java">Hello, world!!!</code></p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; tests/stage3/ex1
&gt; 'Scarlett',1,0
testfile1.txt: [[0, 0, 8]]</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: <em>You have three files, you are looking look for several words and need two files starting from the second one</em></p>

<p>Folder contents: <em>testfile4.txt, testfile5.txt, testfile6.txt</em></p>

<p><em>testfile4.txt</em> contents:<br>
<code class="java">Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton, she made a pretty picture.</code></p>

<p><em>testfile5.txt </em>contents:<br>
<code class="java">Stuart and Brent considered their latest expulsion a fine joke.</code></p>

<p><em>testfile6.txt </em>contents:<br>
<code class="java">It was for this precise reason that Stuart and Brent were idling on the porch of Tara this April afternoon.</code></p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; tests/stage3/ex2
&gt; 'Stuart and Brent',5,1
testfile5.txt: [[0, 0, 6], [0, 7, 10], [0, 11, 16]]; testfile6.txt: [[0, 36, 42], [0, 43, 46], [0, 47, 52]]</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong>: <em>No such words in files</em></p>

<p>Folder contents: <em>testfile7.txt</em>, <em>testfile8.txt</em></p>

<p><em>testfile7.txt </em>contents:<br>
<code class="java">Although born to the ease of plantation life, the faces of the three  were neither slack nor soft.</code></p>

<p><em>testfile8.txt </em>contents:<br>
<code class="java">Scarlett O’Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it </code></p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; tests/stage3/ex3
&gt; 'Natasha Rostova',1,1

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong>:<em> </em><em>Limit is zero</em></p>

<p>Folder contents: <em>testfile9.txt</em>, <em>testfile10.txt</em></p>

<p><em>testfile9.txt </em>contents:<br>
<code class="java">The war, goose! The war’s going to start any day.</code></p>

<p><em>testfile10.txt </em>contents:<br>
<code class="java">You know there isn’t going to be any war, It’s all just talk.</code></p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; tests/stage3/ex4
&gt; 'war',0,0

</code></pre>
