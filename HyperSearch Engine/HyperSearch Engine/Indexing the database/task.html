<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you will create a database that stores unique tokens and their positions in the text. Imagine a document contains only one line: <code class="java">John is a 4th-year student</code>, so the resulting <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal;"><code class="java">("student", 19, "alpha")</code> </span>token is stored in line no. 0 (remember, enumeration starts from zero!). The token starts at 19, which is already known from the previous step, and ends at 19 + 7 = 26 as there are seven letters in the word <code class="java">student</code>. The indexer should take tokens as <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal;"><code class="java">("student", 19, "alpha")</code> </span>and generate their positions, for example <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal;"><code class="java">("student", 0, 19, 26)</code>.</span> The indexer works the same way as the tokenizer: it does not store anything in memory, it generates and outputs the results for each token. It should work when the file is empty. In this case, the program should output <code class="java">None</code>.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you need to write an indexer that assigns a search index (a list of positions) to tokens and creates a structure that will store the information about these indexes. Please note that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The input is a path to the folder with files; the indexer should take their names one by one and implement indexing for each file; the output is a database, which looks like this: <code class="java">{'word': {'filename.txt': [position1, position2, ...]}, 'word2': ...}</code>.</li>
	<li>The positions of tokens (the <code class="java">[position1, position2, ...]</code> list) should be stored in ascending order, line by line, from the very first line in the file to the very end of the very last line in the same file.</li>
	<li>The ascending order is based on how many lines a file contains, and what the starting and ending indexes are. For example, a position instance found in the first line of the file will be placed before the position found in the second line of the file. If both positions are found in the same line, the position with a smaller starting index will be placed first. If both positions are found in the same line and have the same starting index, the position with a smaller ending index will be placed first. </li>
</ul>

<p>Don't<span style="color: #ff4363;"> </span>forget to print the resulting dictionary.</p>

<p>You may want to write your own test programs that will check your code. Check whether it takes the right input format, that it can work with any number of files, and saves the positions of each token. Note that when writing tests, you need to create your own text files, tokenize and index them, and build a small test base using the indexer.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, your indexer should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take a directory path as input, find all <em>.txt </em>files, and start processing them one by one,</li>
	<li>Read each file line by line,</li>
	<li>Implement tokenization from the previous step,</li>
	<li>Produce token pairs and their indexes (positions),</li>
	<li>Add these pairs to the database.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do not create a new database each time you add a new file, just add new tokens and positions to the same database. Bear in mind that the database should be closed after use. </p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p>During tests, you are given a test directory. Input is a folder path, where you need to find and process all text files. Your program should take this path and iterate over files. Clear your database after each test.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: <em>One file with one word in it</em></p>

<p>Folder contents: <em>testfile1.txt</em></p>

<p>File contents<span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal;">: </span><code class="java">student</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; tests/stage2/ex1
{
    'student': {'testfile1.txt': [[0, 0, 7]]}
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: <em>Two files with strings</em></p>

<p>Folder contents: <em>testfile2.txt</em><samp><em>,</em></samp><em>testfile3.txt</em></p>

<p><em>testfile2.txt</em><em> </em>contents: <code class="java">John is @ student</code></p>

<p> The output of <em>testfile2.txt</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">{
    'John': {'testfile2.txt': [[0, 0, 4]]},
    'is': {'testfile2.txt': [[0, 5, 7]]},
    'student': {'testfile2.txt': [[0, 10, 17]]}
}</code></pre>

<p><em>testfile3.txt c</em>ontents:  <code class="java">Mary loves John</code></p>

<p>The output of <em>testfile3.txt:</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; tests/stage2/ex2
{
    'John': {'testfile2.txt': [[0, 0, 4]],
    'testfile3.txt': [[0, 11, 15]]},
    'is': {'testfile2.txt': [[0, 5, 7]]},
    'student': {'testfile2.txt': [[0, 10, 17]]},
    'Mary': {'testfile3.txt': [[0, 0, 4]]},
    'loves': {'testfile3.txt': [[0, 5, 10]]},
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong><em> </em><em>One file with two strings</em></p>

<p>Folder contents: <em>testfile4.txt</em></p>

<p><em>testfile4.txt </em>contents: <code class="java">Her true self was poorly concealed \n Her eyes were her own.</code></p>

<p>Output: one database containing pairs from the file</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; tests/stage2/ex3

    Her: {'testfile4.txt': [[0, 0, 3], [0, 36, 39]]};
