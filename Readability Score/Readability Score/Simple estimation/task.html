<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered how to measure whether the text is hard or easy? The task is pretty simple if you're a human â€” read the text to see if you're struggling or not. However, it is a bit more complicated with computers.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">Do not lemmatize.</div></p>

<p>Let's create a simple program. If a text contains more than 100 symbols (including spacebars and punctuation marks) then mark this text as <code class="java">HARD</code>. If the text contains exactly 100 symbols (or less) mark it as <code class="java">EASY</code>.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Read the text from the user input.</li>
	<li>Count the symbols in the text.</li>
	<li>Output the result.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is simple to read!

EASY                          </code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is hard to read. It contains a lot of sentences as well as a lot of words in each sentence.

HARD                                                                                                   </code></pre>
