summary: Oh, you've come this far! Sometimes it’s nice to get back to the basics —
  remember linear algebra from the school days? In this project, you will write a
  program that solves linear equations (if only you had it earlier...) It is not supposed
  to work with powers and radicals, but on the other hand, it will be able to handle
  matrices and complex numbers.<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/144</a>
