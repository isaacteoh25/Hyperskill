<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Our task is becoming more complicated! Now we have one additional variable (<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>) and one additional equation. In general, this equation would look like this:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[\begin{cases} ax+by=c \\ dx + ey = f\end{cases}\]</span></p>

<p>where <span class="math-tex">\(a, b, c, d, e, f\)</span> are numbers. The general algorithm is to separate the variables so that the first variable is solved in the first line and the second variable is solved in the second line.</p>

<p>The main concept here is to subtract rows. You already know how to subtract numbers, and row subtraction is pretty similar. The example below shows the subtraction of the first row from the second one:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ dx - ax + ey - by = f - c \end{cases}\]</span></p>

<p>As you can see, we subtract <span class="math-tex">\(a * x + b * y\)</span> from the left side of the second equation, we also subtract <span class="math-tex">\(c\)</span> from the right side of the equation. Since we subtracted equal amounts from both sides, the equation remains correct. You can also simplify it like this:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ (d-a)x + (e-b)y = f - c \end{cases}\]</span></p>

<p>It all comes together when you realize you can subtract only a part of the equation. Let's subtract the first equation multiplied by <span class="math-tex">\(d / a\)</span> from the second equation. Here's the first step of this operation:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[\begin{cases} ax+by=c \\ dx*d/a + ey*d/a = f*d/a\end{cases}\]</span>And here's the result of this operation: </p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ (d-a * d/a)x + (e-b * d/a)y = f - c*d/a \end{cases}\]</span></p>

<p>Notice that <span class="math-tex">\(d - a * d / a\)</span> becomes <span class="math-tex">\(d - d\)</span>, which is <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span>. Therefore, we can exclude <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> from the second equation.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ (e-b * d/a)y = f - c*d/a \end{cases}\]</span></p>

<p>At this stage, we can find the <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> value. Divide both sides by <span class="math-tex">\(e - b * d / a\)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ y = \dfrac{f - c*d/a}{(e-b * d/a)} \end{cases}\]</span></p>

<p>Now, you can find the <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> value from the first equation since you know the <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> value. This is similar to what we had in the previous stage.</p>

<p>The first line of the input contains the numbers <span class="math-tex">\(a, b, c\)</span>. The second line of the input contains the numbers <span class="math-tex">\(d, e, f\)</span> numbers. All six numbers are floating-point numbers. Then, you should output the solution (<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>) in a single line.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Write a program that solves the following equations: \[\begin{cases} ax+by=c \\ dx + ey = f\end{cases}\], and prints <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>.</p>

<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take and parse the coefficients from the user's input that consists of six numbers, written in two lines.</li>
	<li>Solve the equation above to find <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>.</li>
	<li>Output <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
