<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A linear equation is an equation of a straight line, often presented as <span class="math-tex">\(y = a * x + b\)</span>. It is called linear because it contains only variables to the power of 1, where <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> are variables, and <span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span> are coefficients.</p>

<p>Linear equations are present in many fields of science and technology. A Sciencing article titled <a target="_blank" href="https://sciencing.com/linear-equations-used-everyday-life-6022370.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">How Are Linear Equations Used in Everyday Life?</a> can give you more detail on this. Over the course of this project, you are going to write quite a powerful linear solver, but for now, we will start with a simple one.</p>

<p>Write a program that solves <span class="math-tex">\(a * x = b\)</span>.</p>

<p>Numbers <span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span> should be read from the first line of the standard input. You should output the value <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> so that the equation has a solution. For example, if the input contains the numbers <span class="math-tex">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span>, you should interpret it as <span class="math-tex">\(5 * x = 3\)</span>. For this example, the answer would be <span class="math-tex">\(0.6\)</span>, as <span class="math-tex">\(5 * 0.6 = 3\)</span>.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Write a program that solves <span class="math-tex">\(a * x = b\)</span> and then prints a solution.</p>

<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Read and parse the <span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span> coefficients from the user input.</li>
	<li>Solve the <span class="math-tex">\(a * x = b\)</span> equation.</li>
	<li>Output <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; 5 3
