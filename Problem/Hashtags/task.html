<h2>Hashtags</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>A hashtag is metadata used in social networks to easily tag a message with user-defined words. Hashtags start with <strong>#</strong> (the number sign, or octothorpe, whichever word you prefer). A user just places <strong>#</strong> in front of a particular word in the message. That helps other users to find this message along with other messages containing this word.</p> 
  <p>In this task, you should find all the words in a message that are hashtags. Try not to use standard Python string methods because we want you to practice algorithms. A hashtagged word starts with a <em>single </em>symbol <strong>#</strong> and ends with space or any of these punctuation marks <code class="java">.,!?</code>. Also, a hashtagged word counts if it is the last word in a message, even though there is no trailing space or punctuation mark after it.</p> 
  <p>Print each word that matches these criteria on a new line.</p>
