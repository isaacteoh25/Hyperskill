<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>Before you get started with implementing the project, we recommend you look through a <a target="_blank" href="https://likegeeks.com/nlp-tutorial-using-python-nltk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">NLTK tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>News texts are usually written by people (at least, for now) and have a certain structure. The <strong>inverted pyramid</strong> is one of the most popular news texts' structures: the first paragraph or even the first few sentences contain the most important information. This part of the text is usually called <em>a lead.</em> It explains the what, where, when, why, and who of the story.</p>

<p>Let's use this simple fact to write a good baseline for the text summarization task. Just extract the first <em>sqrt(N)</em> sentences of the text (<em>N</em> is the number of the source text's sentences), and there you go: you made your first babysteps in NLP!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Read an XML-file with news texts.</li>
	<li>Extract the headers and the texts.</li>
	<li>Tokenize each text into separate sentences.</li>
	<li>Extract and print the headers and the first <em>sqrt(N</em>) sentences, where <em>N</em> is the number of the source text's sentences for each piece of news.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that for this project, you should transform <em>sqrt(N)</em> into an integer with the help of a round function.</p>

<p>We recommend that you use the <code class="language-xml">xml.etree</code> module to parse the given XML-file. However, you may also work with the XML-file via BeautifulSoup library's parsers.</p>

<p>In this stage, your program does not get any input: you should just read the news from the <em>news.xml</em> file. Do not make any changes to this file. Note that the number of news pieces in one file may vary.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">All sentences start on a new line. If there are several sentences on one line, consider them all as one sentence.</div></p>

<p>Once you got the summaries for each piece of news, print them as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">HEADER: first news header
TEXT: first news summary

HEADER: second news header
TEXT: second news summary

HEADER: third news header
TEXT: third news summary</code></pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Input file structure:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF8'?&gt;
&lt;data&gt;
  &lt;corpus&gt;
    &lt;news&gt;
      &lt;value name="head"&gt;New Portuguese skull may be an early relative of Neandertals&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;value name="text"&gt;Half a million years ago, several different members of our genus, Homo, had spread throughout Europe and Asia, where some would eventually evolve into Neandertals. 
      But which ones has been the subject of intense debate. 
      A newly discovered partial skull is offering another clue to help solve the mystery of the ancestry of Neandertals. 
      Found in 2014 in the Gruta da Aroeira cave in central Portugal with ancient stone hand axes, the skull (3D reconstruction pictured) is firmly dated to 400,000 years old and an archaic member of our genus, according to a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
      The skull shows a new mix of features not seen before in fossil humans - it has traits that link it to Neandertals, such as a fused brow ridge, as well as some primitive traits that resemble other extinct fossils in Europe. 
      This new combination of features on a well-dated skull may help researchers sort out how different fossils in Europe are related to each other - and which ones eventually evolved into Neandertals.&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/news&gt;
    &lt;news&gt;
      &lt;value name="head"&gt;Loneliness May Make Quitting Smoking Even Tougher&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;value name="text"&gt;Being lonely may make it harder to quit smoking, a new British study suggests.
      Using genetic and survey data from hundreds of thousands of people, researchers found that loneliness makes it more likely that someone will smoke.
      This type of analysis is called Mendelian randomization.
      ' This method has never been applied to this question before and so the results are novel, but also tentative,'  said co-lead author Robyn Wootton, a senior research associate at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.
      ' We found evidence to suggest that loneliness leads to increased smoking, with people more likely to start smoking, to smoke more cigarettes and to be less likely to quit,'  Wootton said in a university news release.
      These data mesh with an observation that during the coronavirus pandemic, more British people are smoking.
      Senior study author Jorien Treur said, ' Our finding that smoking may also lead to more loneliness is tentative, but it is in line with other recent studies that identified smoking as a risk factor for poor mental health.
      A potential mechanism for this relationship is that nicotine from cigarette smoke interferes with neurotransmitters such as dopamine in the brain.' 
      Treur is a visiting research associate from Amsterdam UMC.
      The researchers also looked for a connection between loneliness and drinking but found none.
      Still, if loneliness causes people to smoke, it is important to alert smoking cessation services so they can add this factor as they help people to quit, the study authors said.
      The report was published June 16 in the journal Addiction.&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/news&gt;
