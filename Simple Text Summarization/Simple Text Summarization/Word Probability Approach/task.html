<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>In this stage, you will implement the <strong>SumBasic</strong> system. This approach to text summarization is based on word frequencies. Let's see how  to implement it.</p>

<p>First, count the probability for each word in the text: <span class="math-tex">\(P(w)=\frac{f(w)}{N}\)</span> , where <em><span class="math-tex">N</span></em> is the number of all words in the text, and <em><span class="math-tex">f(w)</span></em> is the number of occurrences of the word <span class="math-tex">w</span>.</p>

<p>To determine the sentence importance, for each sentence <span class="math-tex">\(S_j\)</span> in the input, assign a weight <span class="math-tex">\(g(S_j)\)</span> that equals an average probability of the words in the sentence: <span class="math-tex">\(g(S_j)=\frac{Σ_{w_i∈S_j}P(w_i)}{∣\{w_i∣w_i∈S_j\}∣}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Now pick the best scoring sentence that contains the highest probability word. This way, you can make sure that the highest probability word that represents the main idea of the text is included in the summary.</p>

<p>For each word in the chosen sentence, update its weight: <span class="math-tex">\(P_{new}(w_i)=P_{old}(w_i)∗P_{old}(w_i)\)</span>. This weight update indicates that the probability of a word appearing in the summary is lower than a word occurring once. So, we lower the probabilities of the words in the chosen sentence so that this sentence does not appear in the summary again.</p>

<p>After the word probabilities are updated, for each sentence determine its importance again, pick the new best scoring sentence, add it to the summary, and update the word probabilities. Repeat these steps until you get the desired length of the summary.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Word probability is one of the most fundamental concepts in NLP. Before the emergence of neural networks in NLP, statistical methods based on probabilities dominated over rule-based methods.</p>

<p>In this stage, you will implement the SumBasic system, which is a simple approach to text summarization based on word probabilities. You may find this stage a bit harder than the first one, but don't be scared of the formulae: they are not that difficult as you may think!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Steps 1-3 are the same as in the first stage. The second stage implies completing the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Read an XML-file with news texts.</li>
	<li>Extract the headers and the news texts.</li>
	<li>Tokenize each text into separate sentences.</li>
	<li>Tokenize sentences into words.</li>
	<li>Get rid of punctuation and stopwords provided by NLTK.</li>
	<li>Lemmatize each word.</li>
	<li>Implement the SumBasic system for <em>sqrt(N)</em> sentences.</li>
	<li>Print the header and the selected sentences in the order in which they appear in the text.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that for this project, you should use a round function to transform <em>sqrt(N)</em> into an integer. Also, summarized news texts should be made of unprocessed sentences.</p>

<p>Tokenization into words (or tokens, to be more precise) is an extremely important step for NLP. There are lots of ways to do it - from regular expressions to machine learning. For this project you have to use <em>word_tokenize() </em>function from<em> nltk. </em>It returns list of words, punctuation and divides words like <em>cat's </em>into 2 parts - <em>cat </em>and <em>'s </em>(the second token <strong>shouldn't</strong> be removed). For the same reason we recommend to use <em>WordNetLemmatizer(), </em>but you can also try other lemmatizers.</p>

<p>Your program does not get any input in this stage: you should just read the news from the <em>news.xml</em> file. Do not make any changes to this file. The number of news pieces in one file may vary. An example of its structure can be found below.</p>

<p>Please, don't perform any operations apart from those that are described above. For example, you don't need to perform POS-tagging. </p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">All sentences start on a new line. If there are several sentences on one line, consider them all as one sentence.</div></p>

<p>Once you got the summaries for each piece of news, print them like you did in the first stage.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Input file structure:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF8'?&gt;
&lt;data&gt;
  &lt;corpus&gt;
    &lt;news&gt;
      &lt;value name="head"&gt;New Portuguese skull may be an early relative of Neandertals&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;value name="text"&gt;Half a million years ago, several different members of our genus, Homo, had spread throughout Europe and Asia, where some would eventually evolve into Neandertals. 
      But which ones has been the subject of intense debate. 
      A newly discovered partial skull is offering another clue to help solve the mystery of the ancestry of Neandertals. 
      Found in 2014 in the Gruta da Aroeira cave in central Portugal with ancient stone hand axes, the skull (3D reconstruction pictured) is firmly dated to 400,000 years old and an archaic member of our genus, according to a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
      The skull shows a new mix of features not seen before in fossil humans - it has traits that link it to Neandertals, such as a fused brow ridge, as well as some primitive traits that resemble other extinct fossils in Europe. 
      This new combination of features on a well-dated skull may help researchers sort out how different fossils in Europe are related to each other - and which ones eventually evolved into Neandertals.&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/news&gt;
    &lt;news&gt;
      &lt;value name="head"&gt;Loneliness May Make Quitting Smoking Even Tougher&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;value name="text"&gt;Being lonely may make it harder to quit smoking, a new British study suggests.
      Using genetic and survey data from hundreds of thousands of people, researchers found that loneliness makes it more likely that someone will smoke.
      This type of analysis is called Mendelian randomization.
      ' This method has never been applied to this question before and so the results are novel, but also tentative,'  said co-lead author Robyn Wootton, a senior research associate at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.
      ' We found evidence to suggest that loneliness leads to increased smoking, with people more likely to start smoking, to smoke more cigarettes and to be less likely to quit,'  Wootton said in a university news release.
      These data mesh with an observation that during the coronavirus pandemic, more British people are smoking.
      Senior study author Jorien Treur said, ' Our finding that smoking may also lead to more loneliness is tentative, but it is in line with other recent studies that identified smoking as a risk factor for poor mental health.
      A potential mechanism for this relationship is that nicotine from cigarette smoke interferes with neurotransmitters such as dopamine in the brain.' 
      Treur is a visiting research associate from Amsterdam UMC.
      The researchers also looked for a connection between loneliness and drinking but found none.
      Still, if loneliness causes people to smoke, it is important to alert smoking cessation services so they can add this factor as they help people to quit, the study authors said.
      The report was published June 16 in the journal Addiction.&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/news&gt;
